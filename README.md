# IntelligentFC_1.0
A multi-rotor flight controller software, built to piggy-back on Arduino IDE and hardware, employing artificial intelligence to minimize user tuning. Heavily focused on transparency, portability, and independence.

For a user to use this software, they must download Arduino IDE, clone this repository, open the main file with Arduino IDE, specify user preferences in a particular header file, and upload the code to the proper board. I will eventually provide schematics for a shield to provide easy hobbyist accessability to the board.

All functionality must exist either in the standard Arduino c libraries, or be fully expressed in committed headder files. No 3rd party intallations can be required.

I will provide instructions on how to organize code as it matures.
